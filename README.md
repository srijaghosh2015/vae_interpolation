This project was done in with the guidance of Ayush Bhandari. I have uploaded my fingertracking logic which maps finger position to coordinate points, my website where one can upload their musical grid with the corresponding MIDI values, and the python code I used to create my generative musical grids.

Please note that this project required many dependencies that were too large to include into this repo. Please download Google's MusicVAE model "cat-mel_2bar_big.tar" and set up a corresponding Docker environment to bypass this.

Feel free to reach out with any questions!
